You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* Skills: 
 -I maintain a .html Sublime text file (I've named it: HTML_Structure.html) in which I add all new HTML elements learned as the course progresses. It allows for quick reference access.

 -I'm learning to developi an eye for detail: almost missed out on the superscript tag requirement if not mentioned as a project hint.

* Easy
 -Udacity is making it easy. It is a breeze if I follow all directions carefully.

* Difficult
 -I remember trying to learn relative and local paths in my college web development cours. It took me more than hour to grasp the concepts.
 -Udacity's relative/local path explanation allowed me to grasp concepts within 10 minutes.

* Problem solving strategies
 -Taking 10 minute breaks (rest, lay down, close my eyes, look out of window) every hour to allow the mind to regurgitate course material better.
 -Keep Mozilla Developer Network weblink open.
 -Keep HTML_Structure.html open for quick HTML element reference.
 -Dual monitor setup is god send for web development!
